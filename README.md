This code performs denoising using a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) on images of pandas and bears. The autoencoder is trained on noisy images, and then it is tested on both noisy and clean images. The code includes data loading, preprocessing, defining the CAE architecture, training, and evaluation.
